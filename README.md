# Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## Objective
Understand what makes a password strong by creating various passwords of varying complexity and testing their strength using online password strength checkers.

## Tools Used
- Online password strength checkers such as [passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com/)
- Kali Linux for file management and documentation

## Steps Performed
- Created multiple passwords with varying length and character complexity.
- Tested each password on the password strength checker.
- Noted scores and feedback from the tool.
- Researched common password attack methods like brute force and dictionary attacks.
- Summarized best practices for creating strong passwords.

## Password Strength Results

| Password               | Strength | Tool Feedback                                           |
|------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 12345678               | Weak     | Too short, common password                              |
| admin@123              | Weak     | Common pattern, insufficient complexity                 |
| admin                  | Weak     | Very common, lacks complexity                            |
| password               | Weak     | Extremely common, lacks numbers/symbols                 |
| pass1234               | Weak     | Predictable, lacks symbols and uppercase                |
| admin1234              | Weak     | Common, lacks symbols and uppercase                      |
| secure@123             | Medium   | Uses symbols but based on common word                    |
| welcome                | Weak     | Common word, lacks variety                               |
| Org_secure@987         | Strong   | Good length and mix of upper/lowercase, symbols, numbers|
| Pattern_log@2003       | Strong   | Mix of character types with digits and symbols          |
| Common_enter@thepass1234 | Strong | Long passphrase with good complexity                     |
| Zero0000@1234          | Strong   | Uses mixed cases, numbers, and symbols                   |

## Best Practices Learned
- Use a mixture of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid dictionary words and common patterns.
- Use longer passwords (12+ characters recommended).
- Consider passphrases for both security and memorability.
- Every account should have a unique password.

## Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force:** Trying all possible combinations until the password is found.
- **Dictionary Attack:** Using known common passwords or dictionary words to guess passwords.
- Password complexity and length exponentially increase the time needed for these attacks.
